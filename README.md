## Remote Ecological Data Analysis and Communications System (REDACS)

### About

**REDACS** is an integrated system which tracks environmental data regarding an ecological location such as a stream, creek, river, and/or pond and its surrounding area and is designed to be deployed in locations where traditional network access such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are not accessible and a cable-based link is not feasible. It is an acronym and each word is similar to a module as in it relates to something specific regarding the system.

#### R - Remote: Deployable to locations where standard means of network access are infeasible.

#### E - Ecological: Designed to serve the important yet vulnerable ecological regions of our planet.

#### D - Data: The system is engineered for data collection using various sensors and modules.

#### A - Analysis: Integrated microcontrollers are programmed to translate raw, analog sensor data into results which can provide meaningful indicators.

#### C - Communications: The embedded RF equipment is configured to transmit the data from the microcontrollers back to a base station for use.

#### S - System: All of the previous components sum up into one interconnected system, to serve a impactful purpose.

### Components

The microcontroller for the system is a Raspberry Pi Pico which is a low-power, cost-effective, space-efficient, yet powerful piece of equipment which can be programmed using the versitile Arduino IDE with its rich repositories of documentation, plug-ins, and libraries.

The RF module is the RFM69HCW 915MHz LoRa Transciever which is is a low-cost, medium-range transmitter designed for small, packet-based data transmissions between two stations, however, (not a goal for this project at the moment) multiple can be configured.
